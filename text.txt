Welcome to AutoSuggest!

This software version makes the user's work more accessible as it is compatible and guesses the words entered by them. 
The small little feature in almost every typing board today makes wonders with its wings. 
It all starts with it trying to guess the words the user is got to enter in due course and suggesting them. 
This indeed makes the work of the user a lot faster as there is no longer a need to type the entire word anymore! 
Lets take a tour of our Autosuggest now!


The words you type would be printed in the form of a sentence with the first letter of the first word capitalized and an added fullstop in the end!
:)

Rules:
1. Enter the word one character at a time.
2. Enter the appropriate options given.
3. Sit back and enjoy!!
